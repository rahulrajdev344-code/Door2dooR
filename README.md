<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Problem Statement

### Problems with current logistic management

- The sad truth of the scenario is that a package stays put at just one place for longer than moving.
- Unhappy customers: A customer is less likely to buy from a merchant who cannot keep to the promised delivery time. Thus reduces Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
- Cash flow trouble: If you don’t deliver your goods on time, you don’t get paid on time. This creates cash flow problems that affect your day-to-day operations.
- Manufacturing hold-up: If the delayed cargo is raw material you imported for an important project, you would be forced to halt production.
- Loss of goods value: An extended transit time can be disastrous for perishable goods. By the time the shipment reaches its destination, it might be worth nothing.

### Proposed Solution

- Conventionally, a package is transferred from src to dest by just one company it creates a lot of delay.
- We can reform this system by introducing the concept of hotspots and multiple party collaboration.
- In this system we would divide the journey of a package into several sub-journeys. These sub-journeys will then be covered by various existing resources like local courier companies/ road/rail/air transportation systems thus reducing the time consumed.
- These sub-journeys are chosen by considering cost, time and quality.
- Several routes are proposed among which client chooses one route suitable for him.
